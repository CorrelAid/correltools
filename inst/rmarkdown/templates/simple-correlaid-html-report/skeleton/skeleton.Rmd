## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r cars}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plot}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) + 
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_correlaid_d()
```
